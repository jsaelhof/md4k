### PR #139 - #138: Add sorting by Source value
##### 2023-12-07

Adds a new sort for Source type. The new sort means there are now too many to fit at a couple of breakpoints, particularly mobile size. Rather than try to build an alternative nav presentation at that size, I decided to just hide the Genre sort for now since it is the least used. I may revisit adding it back in the future. I also cleaned up a couple of small bugs here.

### PR #99 - #96: intersection observer poster bug
##### 2023-07-10

There was some weird rendering issues with my useIntersectionObserver hook. I think it was a race condition that would sometimes report false for "intersecting" when it should be true because the hook was checking before the component had rendered into the DOM. Just a guess based on some reading but I also noticed that the bug went away when I removed their "key" prop, forcing them to remount/rerender. I ended up trying Rooks' useInViewRef hook to see if it would fix the bug and it did. While I don't want to use Rooks too much, this feature is really important for lighthouse scores and app loading. At some point I could copy Rooks implementation if needed.

### PR #93 - #91: Remove use of query selector and fix search field labels

When the new add screen was built, I used a query selector to get to the input fields because I couldn't figure out how to assign a label to an MUI textfield without also overwriting the placeholder and displaying the label above the field. I figured out how to do this later. In the same feature, but on the search screen, I used labels on the fields which worked for the tests but I didn't notice how they affected the UI. This PR also fixes that up using the same solution.

### PR #82 - #81: fix failing skeleton tests
##### 2023-06-03

Fixes the failing skeleton test which was caused by misunderstanding how the mocked provider works. I was trying to mock it as loading but the correct way to test loading is to render and write assertions without waiting. To test after loading, use await to wait for elements to appear in the DOM. 

Fixing this required removing a hack I had built into my renderWithProviders util that created a short sleep to skip the loading state. I had been specifically hacking my way around being in the loading state instead of correct using await findByX to wait for loading to be completed. This realization caused me to rewrite many things related to tests:

- Remove the sleep from renderWithProviders
- Remove async from renderWithProviders
- Update tests that were relying on that sleep to work without out using await findByX
- Update tests to remove as much use of waitFor as possible in favor of await findByX
- Update tests to use screen.<function> instead of destructuring off the return from render/renderWithProviders
- Update tests to use userEvent instead of fireEvent
- Update test setup to provide a setup user object to all tests through context
